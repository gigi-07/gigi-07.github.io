I attend CSUF as a Computer Science major with a focus in Cybersecurity. I plan to graduate in 2026.

## Favorite CPSC 120 Labs


Lab 6 Part 1 I liked Lab 6 Part 1 because it was very challenging. I really enjoyed it despite the challenge and found it fun to make. I also enjoyed messing with it after we had made it.

Lab 7 I found lab 7 to be quite the challenge for me. I really enjoyed the struggle I had with the specifics of every parking sign. I liked how it worked at the end.

Lab 9 Part 1 I had a lot of trouble with lab 9 part 1. It was complex and I felt I didn’t truly understand all the concepts. I did well in the end and enjoyed the lab. I ended up showing it to my parents afterwards as an accomplishment and they were proud.
